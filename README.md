-  I make Medieval Fantasy and Sci-Fi themed games and experiences, so far only on Roblox
-  I spend a good bit of my time programming in the Winter months and working on small engines in the Summer.
-  I am not really a social animal and like to do things alone for the most part but do enjoy some company...
-  I am working on Creating my own Development Studio Astral Forge Games - Unsure if it will stay a solo studio or if I will open positions yet... See above lol
